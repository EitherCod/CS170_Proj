Instruction to run code: python3 solver.py inputs
This reads all inputs from a folder in the root directory named 'inputs', and outputs to a folder called 'out'. The program should take around 2.5 minutes to run. The latest version of networkx is required. If the compiler complains about barycenter, run 'pip install --upgrade networkx'.
